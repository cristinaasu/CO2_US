# Analysis of CO2 Emissions in the U.S.
## Overview of the Project
This project investigates spatial patterns of CO₂ concentrations across U.S. states, analyzing changes in emissions and exploring their relationship with urbanization and population density. The analysis employs spatial statistical techniques to uncover clustering trends and identify key areas of concern.

# Reproducing the Analysis
To replicate the analysis and results:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open `code.qmd` in your Quarto or RStudio environment.
3. Run the file to reproduce the full analysis, including all visualizations and results.
4. Refer to `paper.pdf` for a detailed explanation of the findings.

# Key Highlights
- Spatial Analysis: Utilized advanced spatial models to examine clustering in CO₂ emissions.
- Visualization: Created detailed maps and plots to showcase spatial patterns and relationships.
- Insights: Highlighted key trends in emissions reduction and persistent hotspots in urban-industrial regions.
